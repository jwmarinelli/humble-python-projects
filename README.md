# humble-python-projects
A running list of all the python projects as I teach myself to code. Will keep initial versions and add updated versions to show my learning progress as I go.

madlibs_game
These are some of my first exercises in python. After just a few weeks of learning python, I was introduced to escape sequences and f-strings. Once I realized what they could do, I excitedly wrote up a tiny game. The game asks for simple inputs in a madlibs style and prints those inputs into a text.
Every now and then I see something I want to change or learn a new way to make the outcomes more what I want. In that case I'll update the file and save it as a new version, just so I can keep the original for sentimental value. 
Version 2 of this game edits the inputs and uses string methods to make the output text a little cleaner.

Codecademy projects
A large portion of my python knowledge has been coming from working through Codecadmy's course. Currently, I'm on track to complete their Python 3 coure, and the Analyzing Data with Python course. My plan is then to delve into SQL and Javascript

Reggie's Linear Regression is an off-site project that uses Jupyter Notebook. Once students understand the basics of loops, they offer this optional project to apply their knowledge in a short example. The instructions and tasks are included in the project.

Censor Dispenser is another off-site project. This time, Codecaemy simply gives you a set of four text files and tasks you with censoring the words in them through particular functions. The tasks are written here above each function.
